# Aspire Docker SSH Deployment Pipeline

[![feedz.io](https://img.shields.io/badge/endpoint.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Ff.feedz.io%2Fdavidfowl%2Faspire%2Fshield%2FAspire.Hosting.Docker.SshDeploy%2Flatest&label=Aspire.Hosting.Docker.SshDeploy)](https://f.feedz.io/davidfowl/aspire/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Docker.SshDeploy/latest/download)

Deploy Aspire applications to remote Docker hosts via SSH.

## Overview

This package extends Aspire's Docker Compose support with a deployment pipeline that builds container images locally, pushes them to a registry, and deploys to a remote server via SSH. The pipeline handles SSH connection management, file transfers, and container orchestration with `docker compose`.

```

## How It Works

The deployment pipeline executes in phases, with steps running in parallel where possible:

```mermaid

    subgraph Configure
        A[Establish SSH] --> B[Configure Deployment]
        C[Process Parameters] --> D[Build Prerequisites]
    end

    subgraph Build & Push
        D --> E[Build Images]
        E --> F[Push to Registry]
    end

    subgraph Deploy
        F --> G[Prepare Compose Files]
        G --> H[Transfer Files via SCP]
        H --> I[docker compose up]
        I --> J[Health Checks]
    end

    J --> K[Done]
```

**Phase breakdown:**
1. **Configure** - Establish SSH connection, gather parameters (registry, credentials, deploy path)
2. **Build** - Build container images for each project in parallel
3. **Push** - Push images to the configured container registry
4. **Deploy** - Transfer compose files and `.env` to the remote server, run `docker compose up`
5. **Verify** - Run health checks, extract dashboard token, cleanup SSH

## Quick Start

1. Add the package feed:

```bash
dotnet nuget add source https://f.feedz.io/davidfowl/aspire/nuget/index.json --name davidfowl-aspire
```

2. Install the package:

```bash
aspire add docker-sshdeploy
```

Or with the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package Aspire.Hosting.Docker.SshDeploy --prerelease
```

3. Add SSH deployment support to your AppHost:

```csharp
builder.AddDockerComposeEnvironment("env")
    .WithSshDeploySupport();
```

TypeScript AppHosts can reference the package from `aspire.config.json`, run `aspire restore`,
and use the generated API:

```typescript
import { createBuilder } from './.modules/aspire.js';

const builder = await createBuilder();

await builder.addDockerComposeEnvironment('env')
    .withSshDeploySupport();
```

4. Deploy:

```bash
aspire deploy
```

The pipeline will prompt for SSH credentials, registry configuration, and deploy path.

## Documentation

See the [package README](src/Aspire.Hosting.Docker.SshDeploy/README.md) for:
- Configuration options (`appsettings.json`, environment variables)
- SSH authentication (key-based vs password)
- Target host privacy settings
- TypeScript AppHost setup

## Sample Projects

See `samples/DockerPipelinesSample` for a complete C# AppHost example:

```bash
aspire run     # Run locally
aspire deploy  # Deploy to remote host
```

See `samples/DockerPipelinesTypeScriptSample` for a TypeScript AppHost sample that uses the generated
`Aspire.Hosting.Docker.SshDeploy` APIs against the same API and web projects:

```bash
cd samples/DockerPipelinesTypeScriptSample
npm install
aspire restore
npm run build
aspire deploy
```

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

See `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for a complete example using GitHub Container Registry with secrets for SSH credentials.
